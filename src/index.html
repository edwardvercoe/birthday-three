              The good thing about this milestone is that you’re allowed to be as grumpy as you like and no longer give a toss what anyone thinks about it. There are also some bad things but it’s best not to mention them. Have a brilliant day and try not to be too graceful about it.

              many memorable lunches/dinners/ sessions/inappropriate yet hilarious conversations, for caring about my family and being a proper, honest-to-goodness friend. You are a special one. And fabulous to boot!

                      Warmest birthday greetings to a wonderful woman who hasn’t aged a day since we met, about four Sydney lifetimes ago. Am sure you’ll execute a signature perfect double pike over this irrelevant milestone BB and am assured by Deborah Hutton herself (Stellar, 12/09/21) the next
                      big birthday is a doddle - and Deb’s word is as good as gold! Looking forward to raising a glass with you at the earliest, Sharpie xxx

                      BB Life of the party ! I am sure where ever or whatever your birthday celebration is , it will be a cracker, filled with laughter, some naughtieness, I suspect some cracking cocktails and who knows ...... late at night perhaps the "pouch of truth" . Play Hard Play Safe _ TB

                      Dear Brilliant BB, happy birthday!! I cannot believe that there is no big shebang for the guru of good times and great entertaining. I just wanted to say I miss seeing you, and what a clever and beautiful person you are, and that I can't wait to have big belly laughs and
                      ridiculous conversations when we can finally celebrate your big day. Wishing you a bottle of lockdwon Krug all to yourself :) xxx Kerrie

                      Dear Bettina, If you add 11 years to the year of your birth and then find the best song of the year when you were 11-years-old it makes any birthday soundtrack special. This of course relies on the person sending the message knowing when the birthday person was actually born,
                      which of course I don't. So this link is a wild (and potentially deeply insulting) guess.So Happy Birthday, and apologies just in case.

                      on the rose' and good times in Whale Beach. Big love and celebrations soon. Sam C xxx

                      Beautiful BB! If anyone can find a way to rock a lock-down birthday in style I'm sure its the legendary Betty Brown..And as Ive found the great thing about a lockdown 50th is that it just skips a year (at the rate we are going looks like I'll still be 49 by next year!). Hoping
                      you are spolit rotten, missing you and cant wait to have a big bottle of bubbles and plenty of laughs to help you celebrate in person - hopefully soon! Fi xxx
